# Confronting the Confusion Around Healthcare Bills

**LMU MSBA Capstone Project | Cedars-Sinai Health System**

An AI-powered agent that helps patients understand their hospital bills by providing plain-language explanations, identifying relevant financial assistance programs, and generating talking points for conversations with billing departments and insurers.

## Problem Statement

Getting a bill after a hospital stay is often a stressful, confusing experience. Even people with industry experience are frequently confused by what appears on a bill. This project provides patients with:

- AI-generated explanations of all line items on a bill
- A list of resources to reach out to (financial assistance, Patient Services, insurance contacts)
- Talking points and questions to ask when contacting those resources

## Quick Start

```bash
cd agent-harness

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate           # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure API credentials
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API_KEY and API_ENDPOINT

# Run the server
set PYTHONPATH=src              # Windows
export PYTHONPATH=src           # Linux/Mac
python -m app.server
```

Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

### Docker

```bash
cd agent-harness
docker compose up --build
```

## Knowledge Base

The `knowledge-docs/` directory contains Cedars-Sinai billing and financial assistance documents that are indexed on startup and searchable via RAG. Key resources include:

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Billing FAQ | Common patient questions about billing, payments, insurance |
| Glossary | Definitions of billing/insurance terms (deductible, coinsurance, EOB, etc.) |
| Financial Assistance Policy | Eligibility criteria and application process for charity care |
| FPL Percentages | Federal Poverty Level thresholds for assistance qualification |
| Chargemaster | Full list of hospital charges |
| Common Procedures | Pricing for 25 most common outpatient procedures |
| Debt Collection Policy | Patient rights and collection process |

## Architecture

The application uses an **agent harness** pattern:

1. **Agent Loop** (`agent_harness/core.py`) — Calls the LLM, executes tool calls, and repeats until the agent has a final response
2. **Tools** — Functions the LLM can invoke (explain bill line items, calculate FPL eligibility, search knowledge base)
3. **Hooks** — Safety checks that run before/after each tool call (PHI redaction, content filtering)
4. **Skills** — Markdown instructions loaded into the system prompt for procedural guidance
5. **Roles** — Identity documents for specialized sub-agents
6. **RAG** — TF-IDF search over indexed knowledge documents (upgradeable to embeddings)

Supported LLM providers: OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure OpenAI.

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Description | Location |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Tool | A function the LLM can call | `agent-harness/src/app/tools/` |
| Hook | Safety check before/after tool execution | `agent-harness/src/app/hooks/` |
| Skill | Instructions loaded into the system prompt | `agent-harness/src/app/skills/` |
| Role | Identity for a specialized sub-agent | `agent-harness/src/app/roles/` |
| RAG | Retrieval-augmented generation over local docs | `agent-harness/src/app/rag/` |

## Extending the Application

See [`agent-harness/README.md`](agent-harness/README.md) for detailed instructions on:

- Adding new tools
- Adding safety hooks
- Adding skills and sub-agent roles
- Improving RAG with embeddings
- Integrating external APIs

## Deliverables

The final product is a working web application that:

1. Accepts patient bill uploads (images, PDFs)
2. Explains all line items in plain language
3. Searches the knowledge base for relevant policies and resources
4. Calculates financial assistance eligibility (FPL-based)
5. Provides empathetic explanations and next-step recommendations
6. Runs in a Docker container

## Stakeholders

- **Primary beneficiary**: Patients receiving bills from Cedars-Sinai
- **Secondary beneficiary**: Billing customer service (reduced call volume)
- **Support**: Revenue Cycle team + AI team at Cedars-Sinai

## Data & Privacy

- Patient data is mocked/synthetic — no real PHI
- All non-synthetic data must remain within Cedars environments
